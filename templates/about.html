    <h2 class="text-center mt-lg-3"><u style="color: #0a2b1d">About</u></h2>
    <div class="container my-lg-5" style="font-size: 18px;">
        In the past decades, there is an increasing interest in predicting markets among economists, policymakers,
        academics and market makers. The objective of the proposed work is to study and improve the supervised learning
        algorithms to predict the stock price.
        <br>This project will be implemented in Python. The system must be able to access a list of historical prices by
        nsepy python module. It must calculate the estimated price of stock based on the historical data. It must also
        provide an instantaneous visualization of the market index.

            <h3>Login:</h3>
        <br>
        The first page that users will encounter will be the login page. All users will be required to either login to
        an existing account or sign up for a new one. This page will show a simple box with two input areas where the
        user can enter their user name and password. Underneath this input are two buttons next to each other. The left
        button will be the Login button and the button next to it is the Sign-up button.
        <br>
        Clicking the Login button will either bring you to the home page if you entered the correct username and
        password or it will just refresh the login page with an error stating that you have entered your credentials
        wrong.

        <br><br>
        <h3>Sign Up / Registration:</h3>
        <br>
        On the login page, if a user is not already registered, they can sign up to create a new account by clicking on
        the Sign-up button. When clicked, this button will bring them to the registration page where they will be able
        to create a username and password. They will also be required to enter an email address and optionally enter
        their name.
        <br><br>
        <h3>UI design:</h3>
        <br>
        User interface should be easy to use and user friendly for any system. UI is main attraction of any system. In
        the project user interact with the system through UI. User interface through user can get desired result very
        quickly and easily by just one click. The purpose of this module is to provide the user interface and view
        functions for the system. This is the system with which the user directly interacts and get prediction data.
        This module is created to provide the user interface to the system.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Stock search:</h3>
        <br>
        Through this user can search stocks which are registered under NSE. To get information about stocks, current
        trend of stock and predictions about stock, user has to search about the require stock by its name through the
        search bar. It is easy and convenient way to search about anything for user.
        <br><br>
        <h3> Table and graph formation:</h3>
        <br><br>
        This section is where the graph of the stockâ€™s historical and prediction data will be displayed. The graph will
        have an indicator of the current data and which points on the graph represent the stock prediction. Underneath
        this section, will be a smaller section that will show the open, high, low, and current value of the stock for
        that given hour or however long we decide to refresh the data.

        <br><br>

        <h3> Price prediction:</h3>
        <br>
        Back side of system UI there should be a mechanism which find the prediction price for user. This mechanism is
        algorithm which will work for user to give satisfactory output about stock, so the output of algorithm guide
        user to invest in particular stocks. So, user can minimize the risk associated with stock market trading.
